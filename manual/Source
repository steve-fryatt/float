<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Float</cite> is a &ldquo;Floating Interactive Help&rdquo; application for RISC&nbsp;OS. It is intended to replace Acorn&rsquo;s <cite>Help</cite> application, providing interactive help in small &ldquo;floating&rdquo; panes that follow the mouse around the screen. This is similar to some of the systems available on other platforms.

<cite>Float</cite> will work with any application that supports Acorn&rsquo;s interactive help protocol, that is any application that works with <cite>Help</cite>.

Some of the &ldquo;nice&rdquo; features of <cite>Float</cite> are:

<list>
<li>Configurable pane appearance: font, colours and shadow can be user set
<li>Supports help on window tools
<li>Can ignore help from selected applications (such as Filer, Pinboard, etc)
<li>Supports full iconbar help
<li>Ability to quickly toggle panes on and off
<li>Full support of Help dictionary
</list>

</chapter>




<chapter title="Installing Float" file="Installation">

<cite>Float</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.8 or later; it may work on earlier versions, but requies the Nested Wimp and is not supported. The code should be 26/32-bit neutral and ARMv7 aware, and should therefore run on all hardware systems. <cite>Float</cite> can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc.

To install Float, copy the <file>!Float</file> application to a suitable place on your disc. If you want it to run on startup, <cite>Float</cite> should be placed in your boot sequence. On a machine with the new boot structure installed, this can be done by adding it to the list of tasks to be run on startup via Configure. On older machines, you will have to make your own arrangements (but you will probably have made your own boot system anyway).

<box type="warning">
If you are updating to Float&nbsp;0.40 or later from version 0.36 or earlier, the contents of the application directory have changed. As such, you are advised to delete (or move out of the way) your existing !Float application and replace it with the new one, instead of simply copying the new one on top of the old.
</box>

By default, <cite>Float</cite> will set the system variable &lt;Help$Start&gt; when it is seen or run by the Filer. This makes it the default interactive help client to be loaded if one is required.

This feature can be disabled if required. <key>Shift</key>-double-click on <file>!Float</file> and load the <file>!Boot</file> and <file>!Run</file> files into a text editor (<key>shift</key>-double-click on them). Find the line in each file that starts with:

<codeblock>
Set Help$Start ...
</codeblock>

Comment it out by inserting a vertical bar in front of it, like this:

<codeblock>
|Set Help$Start ...
</codeblock>

Re-save the two files and after the machine has been re-started <cite>Float</cite> will no longer be the default interactive help client.

To restore <cite>Float</cite> as the default client, repeat the process but remove the vertical bar.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Float" file="Using">

To use <cite>Float</cite>, run it in the usual way by double-clicking on the <file>!Float</file> icon in a directory viewer. When its icon appears on the iconbar, pointing at different bits of the desktop will cause help panes to appear after a short (user-defined) interval. Moving the mouse causes the panes to disappear; they disappear on their own after a given time anyway or when the mouse is clicked or a key pressed.

The panes can be toggled on and off by clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the <cite>Float</cite> icon on the iconbar. When the icon is &ldquo;greyed out&rdquo;, no help is provided: this can allow you to get on without the help getting in the way.

</chapter>





<chapter title="User Choices" file="Choices">

Clicking <mouse>adjust</mouse> on <cite>Float</cite>&rsquo;s iconbar icon or selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from its iconbar menu allows many aspects of Floating Help&rsquo;s operation to be altered. The dialogue is split into three sections on separate tabs, which can be accessed by clicking on their buttons in the right-hand margin.

Once the choices have been set as required, clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Apply</icon> will apply them to <cite>Float</cite>; clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will also leave the dialogue open so that further changes can be made. Clicking on <icon>Save</icon> behaves in a similar way, but also saves the changes to disc so that they become the new default options when <cite>Float</cite> is next loaded.

In contrast, clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Cancel</icon> will forget any changes made in the dialogue and close it; clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the dialogue open, but reset its contents to reflect the settings currently in force.


<subhead title="Display options">

The <icon>Display</icon> tab contains options which affect the way that help messages are opened and closed (the <icon>Opening</icon> section), and which messages are presented to the user (the <icon>Messages</icon> section).

<icon>Open panes</icon> determines whether help panes are shown or not. This is not quite the same as clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <cite>Float</cite>&rsquo;s iconbar icon, as it also takes effect when <cite>Float</cite> is next run. If the state of this option is changed, then the new state is reflected on the iconbar when the changes are applied (by clicking on <icon>Apply</icon> or <icon>Save</icon>); if the state is not changed, then the iconbar state is not affected (even if it differs from the setting of <icon>Open panes</icon>).

<icon>Open after</icon> gives the time, in seconds, that the mouse must be &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; for before a pane is displayed. Stationary means that it does not move more than, by default, 8 OS units in any direction.

<icon>Auto close panes</icon> determines whether panes are closed after a given time. If set, panes will be closed after being open the number of seconds given in the <icon>Close after</icon> field; if unset, panes remain on display indefinitely if no mouse or keyboard activity is seen.

<icon>Close on key press or mouse click</icon> indicates whether to close a pane when keyboard or mouse activity is detected, and to prevent a pane from opening if a key press or mouse click occurs before the <icon>Open after</icon> time. <icon>Stay closed over drags</icon> can be used to prevent panes opening at the end of a drag. It can only used if the option above is selected.

The remaining options on this pane control the types of help message to be displayed. <icon>Show help for window furniture</icon> allows the user to decide whether or not help should be shown for the furniture around the edge of a window. If this is off, the potentially distracting messages will not appear. This can be temporarily overridden by the <menu>Show all</menu> option in the iconbar menu.

<icon>Show help over iconbar</icon> selects whether or not help is given for the icons on the iconbar. When on, help is given for all the icons (with the information being &lsquo;made up&rsquo; for those applications who do not provide help if the <icon>Show default message</icon> option is ticked). This setting is ignored (with messages being displayed) if <menu>Show all</menu> is ticked in the iconbar menu.

<icon>Show default message</icon> determines whether or not <cite>Float</cite> will make up messages for applications not responding to the help requests. This message will just identify the application that the window (or iconbar icon) belongs to. If <menu>Show all</menu> in the iconbar menu is ticked, these messages will appear regardless of this setting.


<subhead title="Appearance options">

The <icon>Appearance</icon> tab contains options relating to the appearance of the help message pane.

The <icon>Font</icon> section selects the font used to display the help text. This can be changed by clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the pop-up menu icon to the right of the <icon>Font</icon> field; its size and aspect ratio (the width divided by the height) can also be set. If you have RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5 or later, then ticking <icon>Use desktop font</icon> will ignore these choices and use the currently selected desktop font; if the desktop font is the System font, then the font set in <cite>Float</cite>&rsquo;s choices will still be used.

The <icon>Colours</icon> section specifies the colours which will be used when drawing the help panes. <icon>Text</icon> sets the colour for the text and pane borders, while <icon>Background</icon> sets the colour used for the the pane background. If <icon>Draw shadows</icon> is ticked, then <icon>Shadow</icon> sets the colour for the drop-shadows behind the panes. For each colour, clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the pop-up menu button to the right of the field will allow a new colour to be selected from the Wimp&rsquo;s palette.

The <icon>Draw shadows</icon> switch determines whether to draw drop shadows behind the help panes. When present, these are a fixed size and appear as if the light is from the top left of the screen.


<subhead title="Task Ignore options">

The <icon>Ignore Tasks</icon> section allows <cite>Float</cite> to be configured to ignore help messages from certain applications; the <icon>Ignore</icon> section contains a list of tasks which are currently being ignored.

To add a task to the list, enter its name in the field below the list (at the base of the <icon>Ignore</icon> section, to the left of the <icon>Add</icon> button) and click on <icon>Add</icon>. The name must appear <em>exactly</em> as it does in the <cite>Task Manager</cite>&rsquo;s display, with all spacing, punctuation or control characters reproduced exactly. To make this easier to achieve, the pop-up menu button to the right of the field gives a list of the names of all the applications which are currently running. Task names can be selected from this menu to insert them into the field (after which, <icon>Add</icon> must be clicked to add the name to the list in the usual way).

To remove applications from the list, select their entries (by clicking <mouse>select</mouse> and <mouse>adjust</mouse> in the usual way) and click on <icon>Remove</icon>.

As with the other options for restricting the help messages which are presented, the contents of the ignore list will itself be ignored (such that help will be shown for all applications) if <menu>Show all</menu> is ticked in the iconbar menu.


<subhead title="Other options">

All of the choices are stored in a file called <file>Choices</file>. Depending on whether the machine has a new Boot structure, this will either be at <file>Choices:Float.Choices</file> or at <file>!Float.Choices</file>. The default options can be restored by deleting this file; you should always do this before letting anyone have a copy of <cite>Float</cite> if the file is stored inside the application. Note that if all the options are default there may not be a <file>Choices</file> file present at all.

Some options are not available from the <window>choices window</window>, but these can be added manually to the <file>Choices</file> file using a text editor. One choice occupies a line, with the option name being followed by a colon and the value. The extra options that you can specify here are as follows:

<definition target="Mouse jitter">
How far the mouse can be moved in any direction before the bubble gets closed, measured in OS units. Default is 8.
</definition>

<definition target="Poll delay">
How many centiseconds between WIMP idle poll requests. This value can be increased to reduce the overhead on a slower machine, at the expense of responsiveness. Default is 5.
</definition>


If there is no <file>Choices</file> file, create a new one by opening the <window>Choices</window> dialogue and clicking on <icon>Save</icon>: this will place the file in the correct location for the system it is running on.

Lines in the file starting with a <code>#</code> are comments. An example file might be:

<codeblock>
# >Choices
#
# An example file

Poll delay: 10
Mouse jitter: 16
</codeblock>

<cite>Float</cite> will need to be reloaded to make changes made to the <file>Choices</file> file take effect.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Known Limitations and Problems" file="Problems">

As far as I know there are no bugs in <cite>Float</cite>, although I will probably be proved wrong. There are one or two known limitations, though.

<cite>Float</cite> does not deal fully with the GSTrans specification when it parses help messages. It will treat <code>|M</code> as a line (or paragraph) break, and it will substitute <code>|</code>, <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&quot;</code> for <code>||</code>, <code>|&lt;</code> and <code>|&quot;</code> respectively, but all other GSTrans codes are currently ignored (and stripped out). If you do something like <code>|G</code> or <code>|!)</code> it will not work (the first being ignored and the second coming out as <code>)</code> instead of the copyright symbol).

Two consecutive line breaks (<code>|M|M</code>) are treated as a string terminator. This is deliberate, as it appears to be what Acorn&rsquo;s <cite>Help</cite> does, but it does not appear to be in the specification in the PRMs. Unfortunately, some programs appear to &ldquo;make use of&rdquo; this feature by putting garbage between the <code>|M|M</code> and the help text terminator.

All control characters in the help text are also treated as terminators. This does not follow the spec, which states that a char 0 is the terminator, but some applications use char 13 to terminate and yet more do other nasty things.

Some of the pane hiding features (such as &lsquo;hide across drags&rsquo;) do not always work as expected. This is because the WIMP does not always talk to <cite>Float</cite> enough, especially when dragging and scrolling windows. I am looking into fixing this.

Finally, if a screen refresh occurs (for example by pressing <key>F12</key> followed by <key>return</key>) the area immediately around the pane will be corrupted, especially if a shadow is present. This is a limitation of the way transparent windows are handled by the WIMP, but it is not harmful.

</chapter>
